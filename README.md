# Learn Web Development With Go

This is my log of progress the course: [Learn to Create Web Applications using Go
](https://www.usegolang.com/) created by [Jon Calhoun](https://twitter.com/joncalhoun).

## Why

With a full time job, family, and other passions I've found it difficult to make progress in a seperate field from where I work.
My current work takes a lot of focus, so mental energy to do much extra is limited.

I took the plunge on this course to give a structure to my learning in a new area.
Since I'm working primarily in DevOps/SRE focused roles, cli tooling would be useful, but not many courses cover this as the primary focus.
As my goal with taking on Go is to learn a new way of thinking and stretch myself (see blog post: [Reflections on Being a New Gopher With A Dotnet Background
](https://www.sheldonhull.com/blog/reflections-on-being-a-new-gopher-with-a-dotnet-background/)) I figured this would also be good to focus in on a new domain.

I've not had to deal with web services, designing oauth flow, and other areas this covers.
I think this will actually help me learn Go faster, as I'm finding redoing existing things I know frustrating as I go slower in the language and am applying existing paradigms to it.

I'm logging the terrible code I'll write in public because I'm a big fan of: [Learn In Public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/)
We'll see how this goes!

## Where I'm Starting From

- Development background focused on SQL Server and .NET (PowerShell expertise)
- AWS Background (written a couple lambdas)
- Strong SRE mentality and decent development principles (that I know of at least :grin:)

## Starting

Bypassed most of the git and setup stuff, as already very familiar with that.
Creating GitHub Codespace to use for cloud-based workspace for leveraging this course.

This means the basic codespace (cloud or container workspace) should have dotnet, Go, python, and all other basic libraries already included.
